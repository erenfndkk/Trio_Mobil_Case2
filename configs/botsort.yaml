# BoT-SORT tracker configuration for better Re-ID
# This config helps with occlusion and ID switching issues

tracker_type: botsort

# Matching thresholds
match_thresh: 0.8          # Higher = stricter matching (reduce false associations)
track_high_thresh: 0.5     # Detection confidence for high-quality tracks
track_low_thresh: 0.1      # Detection confidence for low-quality tracks
new_track_thresh: 0.6      # Confidence threshold to start new track

# Track management
track_buffer: 60           # Frames to keep lost tracks (helps with occlusion)
                          # Higher value = better recovery after occlusion
min_box_area: 10          # Minimum bbox area to consider

# Motion and appearance
lambda_: 0.985            # ReID feature decay (higher = remember longer)
with_reid: true           # Enable ReID features
proximity_thresh: 0.5     # Distance threshold for appearance matching
appearance_thresh: 0.25   # Appearance similarity threshold (lower = stricter)

# Kalman filter for motion prediction
